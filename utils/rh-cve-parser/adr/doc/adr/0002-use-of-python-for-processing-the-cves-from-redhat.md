# 2. Use of python for processing the CVEs from Redhat

Date: 2023-02-12

## Status

Accepted

## Context

For identifying security concerns on our Red Hat stack we need to get the relevant 
CVEs for the products we use and produce a reporting artefact that enables us to see and 
plan for remediation. 
There is an API that enables us to get a list of CVEs and filter them. 
It produces the list in a JSON format, we need to convert that to a Markdown table we can then
place in our documentation. 

## Decision

As there are a few processing steps needed for this action: 
- Read from an URL
- Get JSON formatted result 
- Filter on relevancy
- Produce a Markdown table artifact 

For this we selected python as it has standard libraries to process text, json and filtering processes. 
This would be harder to do in bash as we would have to use tools like sed and awk that needs 
specific knowledge in the team. Also bash/sed and awk are known to have subtle implementation differences 
in releases and OS platforms. Python is more uniform over platforms. This is because the team
may developer these tools on Linux and MacOS and having to run these on Windows dev / jumphosts in the end.


## Consequences

The maintenance and use is simpler than bash as it does a lot of the processing in libraries and the language
is closer to native English.  
However, it needs python capability in the team, 
also it noted that python is not the fasted way to process data though given the 
volume of data and the observation the script runs in under 5 seconds this is not seen as a 
concern as of now.
